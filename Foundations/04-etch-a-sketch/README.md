This is a fourth project  
Etch-a-Sketch style website where you can color cells by hovering mouse over them.    
It has 3 settings, normal, psychedelic and modern.  
Normal is only black cells, psychedelic is random colors and modern is shades of black,  
where you can hover over the same cell to make it darker.  
You can also set the grid size to your desire to make something more complex or simple.
